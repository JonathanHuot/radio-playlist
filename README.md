# ShoutedFM - MTH House
MTH House is a streaming **House** radio of live mix session. However, most of the time of the day you listen only a playlist. It's why, you must have a look on the Schedule on their website http://shoutedfm.mthn.net/index.php?area=house&module=sendeplan, and then select a time slot based on your favorite DJ.

For developers interested, I did a programmatic access of the schedule here (in python): https://github.com/JonathanHuot/shoutedfm
